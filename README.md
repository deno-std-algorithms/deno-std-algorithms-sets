# deno-std-algorithms-sets
Algorithms related to sets.

This code is not designed for "production". It's more for those of us who are prototyping and don't feel like re-inventing the wheel.

## combinations
Code for combineWithRepetitions and combineWithoutRepetitions based off code from [trekhleb/javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/sets/combinations)
## permutations
Code for permutateWithRepetitions and permutateWithoutRepetitions based off code from [trekhleb/javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/sets/permutations)
